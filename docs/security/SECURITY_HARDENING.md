# Rust-Nexus Security Hardening Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Rust-Nexus project to protect against credential exposure, unauthorized access, and security vulnerabilities. These measures are essential before any production deployment or public repository sharing.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Configuration Security

#### Sensitive File Protection
- **nexus.toml**: Contains only placeholder values, not real credentials
- **nexus-working.toml**: Automatically ignored by git, used for local development
- **Certificate files**: All `.key`, `.crt`, `.pem` files are ignored by git
- **Environment files**: All `.env*` files are protected from commit

#### Template System
- Production configs use `.example` suffix (safe to commit)
- Real configs are automatically ignored
- Clear documentation on credential replacement

### 2. Git Repository Security

#### Git History Sanitization
- Used `git filter-branch` to remove sensitive files from all commits
- Cleaned `nexus-working.toml` from historical commits
- Verified no credentials exist in git history

#### Enhanced .gitignore
- Comprehensive patterns for security-sensitive files
- Covers certificates, API keys, configuration files
- Includes project-specific patterns for C2 development
- Protects build artifacts and temporary files

### 3. Pre-commit Security Hooks

#### Automated Secret Detection
- Custom secret scanner (`secret-scanner.sh`) detects:
  - API tokens and keys
  - Real email addresses and domains
  - Certificate content
  - Specific credentials from this project
  - Generic secret patterns

#### Pre-commit Framework
- Configuration for `pre-commit` package with multiple security tools:
  - **detect-secrets**: Baseline secret detection
  - **truffleHog**: Git history secret scanning
  - **Custom scanner**: Project-specific patterns
  - **Code quality**: Rust formatting and linting

### 4. Exposed Credential Inventory

⚠️ **The following credentials were exposed and MUST be rotated:**

#### Cloudflare Credentials
- **API Token**: `mQ1XlyuocaCl5JxG40LAH1lEzZ6ekPHFmZg7S97A`
- **Zone ID**: `a15535dbfd0c2457061146a0783a0606` 
- **Domain**: `attck-deploy.net`

#### Contact Information
- **Email**: `attck.community@gmail.com`

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Credential Rotation (CRITICAL)

Before pushing to any public repository:

1. **Rotate Cloudflare API Token**:
   ```bash
   # Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
   # Delete: mQ1XlyuocaCl5JxG40LAH1lEzZ6ekPHFmZg7S97A
   # Create new token with same permissions
   ```

2. **Update DNS Configuration**:
   - Verify `attck-deploy.net` domain security
   - Consider rotating certificates for the domain
   - Review DNS records for any hardcoded values

3. **Certificate Management**:
   - Regenerate any certificates that may have been exposed
   - Verify certificate paths in configurations

### 2. Environment Setup

For secure development:

1. **Copy template to working config**:
   ```bash
   cp nexus.toml.example nexus-working.toml
   # Edit nexus-working.toml with real credentials
   ```

2. **Install pre-commit hooks** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. **Test secret detection**:
   ```bash
   # This should pass (no secrets detected)
   .git/hooks/secret-scanner.sh
   ```

## Security Best Practices

### Development Workflow

1. **Never commit real credentials**
   - Always use template/example files for commits
   - Keep production configs in ignored files
   - Use environment variables when possible

2. **Regular security audits**
   - Run secret scans before major releases
   - Review git history periodically
   - Monitor for accidental credential commits

3. **Code review requirements**
   - All security-related changes require review
   - Verify .gitignore effectiveness
   - Check for hardcoded credentials in code

### Deployment Security

1. **Production credential management**
   - Use external secret management systems
   - Implement credential rotation policies
   - Monitor access to sensitive configurations

2. **Network security**
   - Use TLS for all communications
   - Implement proper certificate validation
   - Configure domain fronting carefully

3. **Operational security**
   - Regular security updates
   - Log monitoring and alerting
   - Incident response procedures

## Verification Checklist

Before pushing to public repositories:

- [ ] All sensitive files removed from git tracking
- [ ] Git history cleaned of credentials
- [ ] .gitignore patterns verified effective
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks installed and working
- [ ] Template files contain only placeholders
- [ ] Real credentials rotated/invalidated
- [ ] Security documentation updated
- [ ] Team members informed of new procedures

## Security Contact

For security issues or questions:
- Report vulnerabilities through secure channels
- Review this documentation before any public commits
- Coordinate credential rotation with team members

## Tools and Resources

### Installed Security Tools
